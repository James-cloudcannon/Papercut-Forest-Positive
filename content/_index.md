        20% of current greenhouse gases are due to tropical forest destruction. The soldiers on the frontlines of the climate change war are the world’s trees. One mature tree absorbs more than 48 pounds of carbon dioxide each year. This creates enough oxygen for a human to breath for 2 years.


        Unfortunately, due to climate change and deforestation, the amount of trees on the planet is shrinking  every day. 


        With 30% trees cut down being used for paper processing, essential business printing needs to do more   than minimize paper waste. We need to maximize positive environmental investment.

          **Forest Positive printing** is extending the Forest Positive evolution into the print space. It allows organisations to actively contribute to more trees being planted than those pulped into printing paper. Forest Positive printing moves beyond reducing waste and transforms essential business printing from a negative environmental footprint to a positive force for reforestation and ecological renewal.

        Caring about the environment isn’t new at PaperCut, it’s embedded in our DNA. This company all started with an overflowing recycling bin at a school library printer. It was the motivation to write a bit of code to reduce waste for one school, and it quickly became a globally used software.
        
        
        For over 20 years PaperCut has created industry-leading print management software that reduces paper waste and saves trees for 115 million users in over 195 countries. To date, our solutions have saved 2.3B pages and 280,451 trees, and counting. 
        
        
        But minimizing waste is no longer enough, we want to do more. We’re now solving the second half of the print equation. Forest Positive printing means we offer waste reduction and direct ecological action by offering customers a way to plant more trees than used by printing.
