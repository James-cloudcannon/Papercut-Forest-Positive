      What is Forest Positive printing? An evolution of the print space, putting
      but back more trees than get pulped into printer paper. Doing what’s right
      for the environment.

    description: >-
      20% of current greenhouse gases are due to tropical forest destruction.
      The soldiers on the frontlines of the climate change war are the world’s
      trees. One mature tree absorbs more than 48 pounds of carbon dioxide each
      year. This creates enough oxygen for a human to breath for 2 years.


      Unfortunately, due to climate change and deforestation, the amount of
      trees on the planet is shrinking  every day. 


      With 30% trees cut down being used for paper processing, essential
      business printing needs to do more   than minimize paper waste. We need to
      maximize positive environmental investment.

      **Forest Positive printing** is extending the Forest Positive evolution
      into the print space. It allows organisations to actively contribute to
      more trees being planted than those pulped into printing paper. Forest
      Positive printing moves beyond reducing waste and transforms essential
      business printing from a negative environmental footprint to a positive
      force for reforestation and ecological renewal.

      heading_hierarchy: h4
      heading_style: h4
    description: >-
      Caring about the environment isn’t new at PaperCut, it’s embedded in our
      DNA. This company all started with an overflowing recycling bin at a
      school library printer. It was the motivation to write a bit of code to
      reduce waste for one school, and it quickly became a globally used
      software.


      For over 20 years PaperCut has created industry-leading print management
      software that reduces paper waste and saves trees for 115 million users in
      over 195 countries. To date, our solutions have saved 2.3B pages and
      280,451 trees, and counting. 


      But minimizing waste is no longer enough, we want to do more. We’re now
      solving the second half of the print equation. Forest Positive printing
      means we offer waste reduction and direct ecological action by offering
      customers a way to plant more trees than used by printing.
