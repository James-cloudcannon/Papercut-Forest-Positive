    20% of current greenhouse gases are due to tropical forest destruction. The soldiers on the frontlines of the climate change war are the worldâ€™s trees. One mature tree absorbs more than 48 pounds of carbon dioxide each year. This creates enough oxygen for a human to breath for 2 years.


    Unfortunately, due to climate change and deforestation, the amount of trees on the planet is shrinking  every day. 


    With 30% trees cut down being used for paper processing, essential business printing needs to do more   than minimize paper waste. We need to maximize positive environmental investment.
